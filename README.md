# LoRa-Programming

Start the IDE and navigate to the Preferences menu. You can access it from the File menu
in Windows or Linux, or the Arduino menu on OS X .

We will only need to add one URL to the IDE in this example, but you can add multiple URLS by separating
them with commas. Copy and paste the link below into the Additional Boards Manager URLs option in the
Arduino IDE preferences.
